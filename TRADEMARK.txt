Lion Trademark License
------------------------

The name Lion™ is a registered trademark of the Lion Trust.

A key part of the business model that allows us to produce and
distribute Lion as completely Free open source software is that
we restrict the commercial use of the Lion trademark to those
who have contracted to support Lion development (Lion Partners).

If you are intending to use the name (and/or logo) to advertise
generic Lion™ services (eg Lion Hosting, Lion Support,
Lion Certification, Lion Training, Lion Consulting,
Lion Customisation, Lion Courseware Development, Lion
Theme design, Lion Integrations, Lion Installations, etc)
or as the name of a software package, then you must seek
direct permission in writing from the Lion Trust via the
lion.com helpdesk, in accordance with normal trademark
restrictions.

There are no restrictions on how you use the name in other
contexts (for example, if you use Lion just to provide
courses then you can use the name freely to refer to it.)

If you aren't sure of a particular case, please ask us via
http://lion.com/helpdesk: we'll be happy to either provide
you with official permission in writing or help you fix
your wording.
