Lion Language Packs

This directory contains the standard packaged Lion language files,
for making the Lion interface appear in different interfaces.

The default language for Lion is the English language, under the
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

To add more languages to Lion, you can either:

 1) use the Lion languages GUI in the interface to fetch
    new languages and install them in your 'dataroot' directory.

 2) download them and unzip the packs in this directory manually
