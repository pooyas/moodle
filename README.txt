QUICK INSTALL
=============

For the impatient, here is a basic outline of the
installation process, which normally takes me only
a few minutes:

1) Move the Lion files into your web directory.

2) Create a single database for Lion to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

3) Visit your Lion site with a browser, you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Lion, creating an admin account etc.

4) Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php
   every five minutes or so.

Good luck and have fun!
